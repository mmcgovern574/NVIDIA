        "In the previous notebook, we learned about embedding models and exercised some of their capabilities. We discussed their intended use cases of longer-form document comparison and found ways to use it as a backbone for more custom semantic comparisons. This notebook will progress these ideas toward the retrieval model's intended use case and explore how to build chatbot systems that rely on *vector stores* to automatically save and retrieve information.\n",

        "- Understand how semantic-similarity-backed systems can facilitate easy-to-use retrieval formulations.\n",

        "- Learn how to incorporate retrieval modules into your chat model systems for a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline, which can be applied to tasks like document retrieval and conversation memory buffers.\n",

            "[Document(page_content='MRKL Systems\\nA modular, neuro-symbolic architecture that combines large language\\nmodels, external knowledge sources and discrete reasoning\\nEhud Karpas, Omri Abend, Yonatan Belinkov, Barak Lenz, Opher Lieber,\\nNir Ratner, Yoav Shoham, Hoﬁt Bata, Yoav Levine, Kevin Leyton-Brown,\\nDor Muhlgay, Noam Rozen, Erez Schwartz, Gal Shachaf, Shai\\nShalev-Shwartz, Amnon Shashua, Moshe Tenenholtz\\nAI21 Labs\\nMay 3, 2022\\nAbstract\\nHuge language models (LMs) have ushered in a new era for AI, serving as a gate-\\nway to natural-language-based knowledge tasks. Although an essential element of\\nmodern AI, LMs are also inherently limited in a number of ways. We discuss these\\nlimitations and how they can be avoided by adopting a systems approach. Con-\\nceptualizing the challenge as one that involves knowledge and reasoning in addition\\nto linguistic processing, we deﬁne a ﬂexible architecture with multiple neural mod-\\nels, complemented by discrete knowledge and reasoning modules. We describe this\\nneuro-symbolic architecture, dubbed the Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Lan-\\nguage (MRKL, pronounced “miracle”) system, some of the technical challenges in\\nimplementing it, and Jurassic-X, AI21 Labs’ MRKL system implementation.\\n1\\nIntroduction\\nHuge language models (LMs) such as BERT [1], GPT-3 [2], Jurassic-1 [3], PaLM [4],\\nand others [5–9], have taken AI by storm, with the promise of serving as versatile,\\ngeneral-purpose foundations for many applications. Indeed, partly for this reason,\\nthey have been rebranded by some as “foundation models” [10]. The term is meant\\nbroadly, covering language models as well as models that were trained on more than\\njust text, and although such multimodal models are not the focus of this paper,\\nthere’s another reason to take the term “language model” with a grain of salt. While\\nLMs indeed model syntax, and other linguistic elements, their most striking feature\\nis that they model the world, as described by the data on which they were trained.\\n1\\narXiv:2205.00445v1  [cs.CL]  1 May 2022\\nAnd so really LMs serve as a textual gateway to the universe of knowledge [11, 12],\\nand perhaps should instead be called “language and knowledge” models.\\nWhen viewed this way, it becomes clear that, despite their value, current LMs\\nhave inherent limitations. While versatile and impressive, the output of even huge\\nLMs is in many cases wrong, and often ridiculously so [13]. Here is a sample output\\nof GPT-3 on some simple queries. (To be clear, this is not a critique of GPT-3 specif-\\nically, and other LMs — including our own Jurassic-1 — exhibit similar silliness.)\\nFor example, LMs can struggle to understand that there are no US cities with\\nmore than 20m citizens, that a math teacher is a person, don’t know what today’s\\ndate is, nor can they engage in even simple (e.g., mathematical) reasoning.\\nWhen you look for the root cause, you realize the core limitations of LMs: They\\ndon’t have access to all relevant knowledge, and neural models are ill-suited for\\ncertain types of calculation. More speciﬁcally:\\n1. Lack of access to current information. Certain data constantly change – the\\nexchange rate between the dollar and the Moroccan Dirham, current COVID\\nnumbers, the stock price of AAPL, the weather in Vancouver (OK, not so\\nmuch), or even the current date. It’s impossible, by their design, for pretrained\\nlanguage models to keep up with this dynamic information [14].\\n2. Lack of access to proprietary information sources.\\nAs an important special\\ncase of 1, the models don’t have access to proprietary information, such as\\nthe client roster in a company’s database or the state of an online game.\\n3. Lack of reasoning. Certain reasoning is beyond the reach of the neural ap-\\nproach, and requires a dedicated reasoning process. We saw above the classic\\nexample of arithmetic reasoning. GPT-3 and Jurassic-1 perform well on 2-digit\\naddition, which is impressive, but conﬁdently spit out nonsensical answers on\\n4-digit additions. With increased training time, better data, and larger mod-\\nels, the performance of LMs will improve, but will not reach the robustness of\\nan HP calculator from the 1970s. And mathematical reasoning is just the tip\\nof an iceberg.\\n2\\nIn addition to these shortcomings, there is another inherent problem with the\\ntraditional approach to deploying LMs:\\n4. Model explosion. Today’s LM’s zero-shot performance trails that of ﬁne-tuned\\nmodels. One can ﬁne-tune the LM to a speciﬁc task, but then lose versatil-\\nity. Contemporary eﬀorts to mitigate the problem focus on training a huge\\nLM jointly on many sets of curated NLP tasks in a massive multi-task setting\\n(several leading studies reaching 100+ tasks) [6, 7, 15, 16]. These formidable\\neﬀorts are eﬀective; the resulting models exhibit versatility and high perfor-\\nmance when encountering inputs resembling those of the curated tasks. But\\nthe performance of these models on tasks that are not close enough to those\\nincluded in the curated tasks can signiﬁcantly deteriorate (for example, per-\\nplexity degrades signiﬁcantly). It is not practical to ﬁne-tune and serve multi-\\nple large models. Nor can one further tune a multi-task-trained LM [6, 7, 15,\\n16] on a new task that hadn’t been covered in its training; due to catastrophic\\nforgetting, adding the new task necessitates retraining on the entire task set.\\nGiven the cost of training such models [17–19], this is clearly infeasible to do\\nrepeatedly.\\nDespite all these shortcomings, large language models are an essential backbone\\nof any future AI system. So the question is how to have our cake and eat it too,\\nenjoying the beneﬁts of self-supervised deep language models without suﬀering these\\ndrawbacks. The solution we oﬀer takes the form of a ﬂexible architecture dubbed\\nthe Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language (MRKL, pronounced “miracle”)\\nsystem, whose high-level design is depicted below.\\nA\\n3\\nThus a MRKL system consists of an extendable set of modules, which we term\\n’experts’, and a router that routes every incoming natural language input to a module\\nthat can best respond to the input (the output of that module can be the output of\\nthe MRKL system, or be routed to another module). These modules can be:\\n• Neural, including the general-purpose huge language model as well as other\\nsmaller, specialized LMs.\\n• Symbolic, for example a math calculator, a currency converter or an API call\\nto a database.\\nMRKL systems enjoy important beneﬁts when compared to ﬁne-tuned multi-task\\nmodels:\\n1. Safe fallback: In case the input doesn’t match any existing expert module, the\\nrouter sends the input directly to the general-purpose huge LM.\\n2. Robust extensibility: Since each expert is trained independently we are able to\\ncheaply add new capabilities while guaranteeing that they do not compromise\\nthe performance of existing ones. The only component that requires retraining\\nis the router which is a relatively lightweight task.\\n3. Interpretability: When the router invokes a speciﬁc module, that often has the\\nside beneﬁt of providing a rationale for the MRKL system’s output (“1+1 = 2\\nbecause the calculator said so”); such explanations are crucially lacking in\\nexisting language models.\\n4. Up-to-date information: The integration of external APIs allows the MRKL\\nsystem to hook into dynamic knowledge bases, and correctly answer inputs\\nthat static models cannot.\\n5. Proprietary knowledge: Access to proprietary databases and other information\\nsources.\\n6. Compositionality: By routing compounded multi-hop inputs to diﬀerent ex-\\nperts we are able to naturally integrate their responses and correctly address\\ncomplex inputs [20].\\n2\\nJurassic-X: AI21 Labs’ MRKL system\\nWe have implemented a MRKL system called Jurassic-X, which is being piloted by\\na few partners.\\nJurassic-X will soon be available to developers; you can apply for early access here.\\nMeanwhile, you can experience Jurassic-X via a demo (link).\\n4\\n3\\nCrossing the neuro-symbolic chasm: A calculator test\\ncase\\nThere are of course many details involved in implementing a MRKL system. In\\nconnection with avoiding model explosion, see our detailed discussion here. There\\nis also an interesting challenge of how to intelligently route input among modules,\\nwhich we leave for a separate discussion. Here we discuss one particularly interest-\\ning challenge, that of extracting from the text the formal arguments to symbolic\\nreasoners.\\n3.1\\nArithmetic as a test case for chasm crossing\\nThe relation between neural and symbolic approaches to AI is guaranteed to raise\\nheated discussions about their relative merits with neuro-skeptics on one extreme,\\nneuro-diehards on the other, and the rest trying to have a rational conversation.\\nBefore discussing our technical approach we’d like to clarify our guiding ideology. We\\nbelieve that neural LMs are essential; we didn’t build Jurassic-1 [3] for no reason, and\\nit serves as a backbone to our applications as well as those of developers using AI21\\nStudio. But as we’ve made clear, we also believe they have inherent shortcomings.\\nWe don’t take a ﬁrm position on which types of computation are best relegated to\\nthe neural machinery, and which should be carved out to symbolic methods. That\\nwill surely be an evolving process. What we do ﬁrmly believe is that some tasks\\nshould be handled by discrete methods, and we should have a clear methodology for\\nhow to hand oﬀthe computation from the neural net to the symbolic procedure.\\nOnce the router has made the decision of which module to call upon, it needs to\\npass the right information to it. The router is a specialized neural net and there-\\nfore invoking a neural module is easy since the neural-to-neural interface is natural.\\nHowever, when a neural network needs to access a database, make an API call, or\\ninvoke another symbolic computation, it must extract from the text discrete param-\\neters required by the module. The main message here is that there is no free lunch,\\nbut that lunch is in many cases aﬀordable. The cost is in training the router to\\nextract the arguments reliably, which must be done rigorously. We make the point\\nby discussing how we trained Jurassic-X to extract basic arithmetic operations.\\nThere are many ways to describe in language a situation that calls for perform-\\ning arithmetic. The most straightforward way is to use mathematical notation, say\\n“3 −1 =?′′. Google search handles it well:\\n5\\nNot much harder is to express it in words, as in “How much is three minus 1”. Google\\nsearch does this well too:\\nBut then it gets tricky. At the lexical level, one may use diﬀerent synonyms that\\ncarry the same meaning: (“twelve”, “12” and “a dozen”). But beyond simple lexical\\nissues, there are phrases that require world knowledge to understand that there is\\nan arithmetic exercise encoded in the text (“I lost one ball”, “I dropped one ball”,\\n“One ball was taken from me”) and what the speciﬁc exercise is. Here Google search\\nstarts to stumble:\\nThis is where language models come in. Note that we limit their role to extracting\\nthe right arguments for the symbolic calculator, not performing the calculation itself.\\n6\\nBut we should approach even this task with sober expectations. As anyone knows\\nfrom elementary school, it’s harder to teach children to solve verbal math problems\\nthan to solve explicitly stated math problems. It’s harder for adults too, and it’s\\nno diﬀerent for the computer. At some point the machine will stumble (indeed, at\\nsome point humans will disagree about the underlying math problem). But when\\nwe decide to invoke a symbolic method we should expect reasonable robustness.\\nThe solution is to train the router to extract the right input independently for\\neach module, with rigorous evaluation of the performance. By way of example, here\\nis how it was achieved simple, one- and two-operation arithmetics.\\n3.2\\nTraining Jurassic-X to extract the arguments for basic arith-\\nmetic\\nOur goal here is not to show how we can extract the most complex mathematical\\nexpressions from text, but how we can extract simple expressions with high reliabil-\\nity, the sort of reliability one would need in a production-grade system. We found\\nthat while extensive pretraining does allow Jurassic-1 to extract the arithmetic op-\\neration in many cases in a few-shot setting, the performance is far from perfect. See\\nAppendix A for a detailed comparison. Using a data augmentation methodology,\\nbased on generating examples from a structured example space, we show that the\\nstatic pretrained LM can be made to achieve near perfect performance.\\nWe empirically investigate two related research questions:\\n1. What is required in terms of data augmentation to achieve near-perfect per-\\nformance in the case of basic mathematical operations?\\n2. How well can Jurassic-X generalize between math problems that vary in type\\nor complexity?\\nTo answer these questions we evaluate the model’s performance on cases where\\nthe test data is drawn from the same distribution as the training data, as well as on\\nout-of-distribution test data (allowing us, for example, to train a model on addition\\nproblems and test it on multiplication problems).\\n3.2.1\\nData Augmentation\\nWe use a small set of templates to generate a set of training and test examples. Each\\nexample is characterized by the following dimensions:\\n1. The numbers used in the arithmetic expression, henceforth the operands. The\\noperands may be digits (e.g., 48) or numbers in word form (e.g., forty eight).\\n2. The number of digits in the operands. We explore numbers of 1–9 digits.\\n7\\n3. The type of operation. We explore addition, subtraction, multiplication and\\ndivision.\\n4. The number of operations in the arithmetic expression. We explore the cases\\nof one and two operations.\\n5. The placement or absence of brackets (in expressions with two operations). In\\nsome expressions the placement of brackets may change the result. We explore\\nall logical possibilities for the case of two operations.\\nTable 10 in the appendix details the templates we use in this set of experiments\\nfor the case of a single operation. In the case of two operations, there are 29 distinct\\ncombinations that have a natural formulation in natural language (see Table 12).\\nThe data can be found here.\\n3.2.2\\nExperimental setup\\nWe conducted our experiments with the 7B parameters J1-large model [3] using\\nprompt-tuning [21] with 10 prompt tokens. Across all experiments, we set our learn-\\ning rate to be lr = 0.3 and used linear decay. The batch size was set to 32 and we\\ndeﬁned a short warm-up depending on the number of steps in each experiment.\\nExperiments 1 and 2 below were trained for 3000 steps, and the reported results\\nhere were the test accuracy evaluated on the ﬁnal model. For the remaining exper-\\niments we used linear weight decay (0.001), which we found to be crucial for the\\nmodel’s performance, and selected the best checkpoint using a validation set. Each\\nexperiment was run 3-5 times, and results show mean ± standard deviation across\\nthese runs.\\nIn all experiments we veriﬁed that there was no overlap between the problems\\nincluded in the training set and those included in the test set. This also includes\\navoiding cases with the same underlying arithmetic expression, but using diﬀerent\\nwordings for training and testing. For a detailed description of the sizes of the data\\nsplits see Section C.\\n3.2.3\\nResults\\nIn the following results we report the accuracy we achieve in diﬀerent experiments,\\nby which we mean the percent of problems in the relevant test set on which the\\nsystem gave the correct answer. (We note again that, since the actual calculation is\\ndone by the calculator module, all errors are due to passing the wrong operations or\\noperands to the calculator.)\\nExperiment 1:\\nGeneralization across diﬀerent number of digits in the\\noperands.\\nInspired by the experiments reported by [2], we test Jurassic-X’s ability\\nto generalize to numbers it has not seen in the training data, including numbers\\n8\\nwith a diﬀerent (and much larger) number of digits. At training time we expose\\nthe model only to single-digit numbers, while at test time we evaluate on numbers\\nwith 1 to 9 digits. In this section we experiment with simple problems, involving\\nonly numbers written as digits (and not numbers as words), one format (format 0\\nfrom Table 10), and a single operation. We explore two settings: one where that\\noperation is addition, and one where it is multiplication.\\nTable 1 presents our results, sliced by the number of digits, and compared to the\\nresults by GPT-3’s approach [2] (as representative of all language models that don’t\\nhave access to external calculator), reported on addition. We note that we trained\\non single-digit operations for all settings while GPT-3 was conditioned on examples\\nwith the same number of digits when answering a certain problem. Our results show\\nthat despite the fact that training was only done on numbers with a single digit,\\nthe model is able to generalize to all numbers of digits explored. This is in stark\\ncontrast to the approach of language models which attempt to synthesize arithmetic\\ncapabilities from the training data, and as a result display a dramatic decrease in\\nperformance as the number of digits increases.\\nNum. digits\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\nAddition\\n1.0\\n1.0\\n1.0\\n1.0\\n1.0\\n1.0\\n1.0\\n1.0\\n1.0\\nMultiplication\\n1.0\\n1.0\\n1.0\\n1.0\\n1.0\\n0.98\\n1.0\\n1.0\\n1.0\\nGPT-3\\nN/A\\n1.0\\n0.804\\n0.255\\n0.093\\nN/A\\nN/A\\nN/A\\nN/A\\nTable 1:\\nRobustness to the number of digits in the operands.

Results for GPT-3 were taken from [2].\\nExperiment 2: Generalization from digits to numbers as words and vice\\nversa.\\nIn this set of experiments, we test the model’s ability to generalize from\\narithmetic questions with digits to ones where the numbers are expressed with words,\\nand vice versa. We note that this task is not trivial considering the fact that the\\ntokenization of a number represented with digits is diﬀerent than that when the same\\nnumber is represented as words. For example, we train the model with examples\\nsuch as “How much is 58 plus 12” and evaluate it on examples such as “How much\\nis twenty seven plus thirteen”, and vice versa. While we vary the lexical choice for\\nspecifying numbers using words or digits, we hold other dimensions of the arithmetic\\nworld ﬁxed, including using only format 0 and holding the type of operation ﬁxed\\nat training and test time.\\n(In the following paragraphs we examine these other\\ndimensions.)\\nTable 2 shows the accuracy for all combinations of training and testing on digits\\nand on words. We notice that in-distribution performance (training and testing on\\nthe same type of input) is close to 100 % accuracy. We further observe that training\\n9\\non words generalizes well to digits. Interestingly, the inverse is not true and the per-\\nformance is much lower, indicating the underlying diﬀerence in the representations\\nof the numbers.\\nTest\\nTrain\\nDigits\\nWords\\nDigits\\n1.0\\n0.156\\nWords\\n0.987\\n0.988\\nTable 2:\\nRobustness to wordings.

One of the most appealing characteristics of language\\nmodels is their ability to abstract away from such variability. Here we test the ability\\nof the model to generalize over formats of arithmetic problems. Experiments are for\\nsingle-operation problems.\\nWe train on a single format (format 0 in Table 10), test on all formats, and\\nbreak the results by format. We report results with all four operation types. Table\\n3 shows that the generalization across formats is perfect in most cases. Format 4,\\nwhich is the only one not phrased as a question (see Table 10) appears to be the most\\nchallenging to generalize to. We note that there are numerous ways to phrase such\\nquestions, hence the ability to generalize across formats, even for the case where the\\nmodel was trained only on one format, is critical for the model’s success.\\nadd\\nsub\\nmul\\ndiv\\nformat 0\\n1.0 ± 0\\n1.0 ± 0\\n1.0 ± 0\\n0.997 ± 0.006\\nformat 1\\n1.0 ± 0\\n1.0 ± 0\\n1.0 ± 0\\n1.0 ± 0\\nformat 2\\n1.0 ± 0\\n1.0 ± 0\\n1.0 ± 0\\n1.0 ± 0\\nformat 3\\n1.0 ± 0\\n0.993 ± 0.012\\n0.997 ± 0.006\\n1.0 ± 0\\nformat 4\\n0.993 ± 0.012\\n0.863 ± 0.237\\n0.977 ± 0.04\\n0.727 ± 0.465\\nTable 3: Robustness to phrasing.

Operands have between 1 and 9 digits. We\\ntest on all types of single-operation problems. The results are shown in in Table 4.\\nConsistent with the previous experiments, training and evaluating on arithmetic\\nproblems with the same operations is consistently successful (accuracy > 0.99 along\\nthe diagonal). Interestingly, we ﬁnd strong generalization in many cross-operation\\ncases (oﬀthe main diagonal in the table). For example, training on addition works\\nalmost perfectly when evaluated on subtraction and multiplication. The division\\noperation is an exception, as models trained on it struggle with multiplication and\\nsubtraction (but perform reasonably on addition). Conversely, models trained on\\nother operations do not generalize very well to division.\\nTest\\nTraining\\nadd\\nsub\\nmul\\ndiv\\nadd\\n0.997 ± 0.006\\n0.96 ± 0.026\\n0.97 ± 0.006\\n0.477 ± 0.127\\nsub\\n0.987 ± 0.023\\n0.997 ± 0.006\\n0.763 ± 0.182\\n0.183 ± 0.196\\nmul\\n0.483 ± 0.466\\n0.817 ± 0.186\\n0.993 ± 0.006\\n0.26 ± 0.2\\ndiv\\n0.787 ± 0.244\\n0.31 ± 0.334\\n0.23 ± 0.214\\n0.993 ± 0.012\\nTable 4: Generalization across operations for single-operation problems. Accuracy\\nwhen training with one operation and evaluating on other operations.\\nFor the second set of experiments, we randomly partition the 29 possible two-\\noperation arithmetic problems (Tables 11, 12) into subsets of 14 and 15 to be used for\\ntraining and testing, respectively. We repeated this process for 10 random splits of\\nthe operations, assuring that only one of the training two-operation problems would\\ninclude brackets. Other settings are as with the ﬁrst set of experiments.\\nTable 5 shows the average accuracy for each of the 29 types of two-operation\\nproblems. The results show that in 22 of the 29 combinations the accuracy exceeds\\n90%, indicating reasonable generalization capabilities for such a setting.\\nExperiment 5: Generalization across a diﬀerent number of operations.\\nThis ﬁnal set of experiments explores the ability of the model to generalize from\\nsingle-operation problems to two-operation problems.\\nAs above, we use all formats (0-4), with operands of 1 to 9 digits (numbers\\nwritten with digits), and train on examples from all four operation types (single-\\noperation problems only). We evaluate on examples with two operations, focusing\\non the situations that do not require bracketing – 16 unique combinations in total.\\nThe results are shown in Table 6 and are organized by the ﬁrst operation (rows) and\\nsecond operation (columns) in the test problems.\\n11\\nFormula\\nMean\\nSTD\\nf=((A+B)*C)\\n0.288\\n0.267\\nf=(A+B*C)\\n0.406\\n0.349\\nf=((A-B)*C)\\n0.562\\n0.194\\nf=(A/(B/C))\\n0.677\\n0.228\\nf=(A-B*C)\\n0.697\\n0.266\\nf=(A*(B-C))\\n0.797\\n0.325\\nf=((A+B)/C)\\n0.867\\n0.265\\nf=(A-(B-C))\\n0.930\\n0.057\\nf=((A-B)/C)\\n0.940\\n0.120\\nf=(A-B/C)\\n0.955\\n0.042\\nf=(A/(B+C))\\n0.960\\n0.042\\nf=(A/(B-C))\\n0.962\\n0.094\\nf=(A+B/C)\\n0.964\\n0.049\\nf=(A*(B/C))\\n0.970\\n0.052\\nf=(A*B+C)\\n0.973\\n0.025\\nf=(A*(B+C))\\n0.974\\n0.025\\nf=(A/B+C)\\n0.981\\n0.024\\nf=(A/B/C)\\n0.985\\n0.017\\nf=(A/B-C)\\n0.987\\n0.022\\nf=(A/B*C)\\n0.99\\n0.015\\nf=(A-(B+C))\\n0.99\\n0.017\\nf=(A*B-C)\\n0.992\\n0.015\\nf=(A/(B*C))\\n0.995\\n0.012\\nf=(A-B+C)\\n1\\n0\\nf=(A+B+C)\\n1\\n0\\nf=(A-B-C)\\n1\\n0\\nf=(A*B/C)\\n1\\n0\\nf=(A+B-C)\\n1\\n0\\nf=(A*B*C)\\n1\\n0\\nTable 5:\\nGeneralization for two-operation problems.

This\\nﬂexible, neuro-symbolic design retains all the advantages of modern LMs, but avoids\\ntheir limitations: a lack of current and/or proprietary information, and an inability\\nto reason symbolically when needed. We discussed some of the technical challenges\\nin implementing a MRKL system, with a special focus on how to cross the neuro-\\nsymbolic divide, which we did by looking at how Jurassic-X — AI21 Labs’ imple-\\nmentation of a MRKL system — was trained to handle basic arithmetic reliably.\\n13\\nA\\nFew-shot vs. prompt tuning\\nPerforming these experiments in a few-shot setting might be a more natural choice\\nthat requires less eﬀort in training these models.

The GI Genius computer-assisted detection device is limited for use with standard white-light \\nendoscopy imaging only. This device is not in tended to replace clinical decision making. K211951\\nPage 1 of 4', metadata={'source': '/content/K211951.pdf', 'page': 3}), Document(page_content='P2 f 4\\nThe indications for use statement is identical to that  for the original unmodified (predicate) device, as \\ncleared under DEN200055. \\nDevice Description: \\nGI Genius is an artificial intelligence-based device th at has been trained to process colonoscopy images \\ncontaining regions consistent with colorectal lesions li ke polyps, including those with flat (non-polypoid) \\nmorphology. \\nGI Genius is compatible with the following Video Processors : Fujifilm VP-7000, Olympus CV-180 EXERA II, \\nOlympus CV-190 EXERA III, Fujifilm VP-4450HD, and Pentax EPK-i7000 Video Processor . \\nGI Genius is connected between the video processor and the endoscopic display monitor. When first \\nswitched on, the endoscopic field of view is clearly identified by four corner markers, and a blinking green square indicator appears on the connected endoscopic display monitor to state that the system is ready to function. \\nDuring live video streaming of the endoscopic video image, GI Genius generates a video output on the \\nendoscopic display monitor that contains the original  live video together with superimposed green square \\nmarkers that will appear when a polyp or other lesion of interest is detected, accompanied by a short sound. These markers will not be visible when no lesion detection occurs. \\nThe operating principle of the subject device is identical to that of the predicate device, this being a \\ncomputer-assisted detection device used in conjunction with endoscopy for the detection of abnormal \\nlesions in the gastrointestinal tract. This device with advanced software algorithms brings attention to images to aid in the detection of lesions. The devi ce includes hardware to support interfacing with video \\nendoscopy systems. \\nDesign changes: \\nThis Special 510(k) describes the design changes inco rporated into GI Genius following its FDA clearance \\nunder DEN200055. The device software version number as cleared under DEN 2000555 was 1.0.2; the \\ndevice software version that is the subject of this Special 510(k) is 2.0.0. \\nThe design changes include a single software design change that falls within the FDA guideline for \\nsubmittal of a new 510(k). A labeling change is also planned, to add non-clinical performance data of the \\nnew software version and to include one additional video processor type in the list of compatible units in \\nthe User Manual. Other minor design changes have been the subject of internal documentation and are \\nbeing advised to FDA for information only. \\nThe software design change includes an upgrade to th e inference engine to optimize algorithm speed and \\nimprove energy efficiency, together with a retraining of the neural network with additional procedure \\nvideos, and improved data augmentation, to improve polyp detection capability robustness. \\nNon-clinical testing: \\nThe following non-clinical verification/ validation activities have been completed: \\nxVerification of the revised software at the system level. Each element of the SRS was tested and found\\nto meet specified requirements, testing 14 Units and 9 Items, encompassing 133 software\\nrequirements.K211951\\nPage 2 of 4', metadata={'source': '/content/K211951.pdf', 'page': 4}), Document(page_content='P3 f 4\\nxValidation of the revised software at the user level, testing 14 Units and 9 Items, encompassing 133\\nsoftware requirements.\\nxProtective measures identified by risk management ha ve been verified during Installation Qualification\\nand Operational Qualification.\\nxElectromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) and Electrical Safety compliance tests have been completedaccording to IEC 60601-1 and IEC 60601-1-2 requirements.\\nxStandalone Performance Testing has been carried ou t to assess the performance of the subject device\\nin accordance with the same test protocol as that used for the predicate device, the results of which\\ndemonstrate substantial equivalence to the predicate device.\\nxNon-inferiority of performance of GI Genius with a new video processor has been established bymeans of a per-frame assessment on 40 pre-recorded procedures.\\nThe results of the above testing aid in demonstration of  substantial equivalence of the subject device with \\nthe predicate device, as the same test protocols have been used. \\nSubstantial equivalence \\nThe predicate device for the subject device is the pre- modification version of the same device, GI Genius, \\nFDA-cleared under DEN200055 on 9 April 2021: \\nPredicate Device: GI Genius Sponsor: Cosmo Artificial Intelligence - AI Ltd \\nDe Novo Number: DEN200055 \\nClearance Date:  9 April 2021 FDA Product Code: QNP \\nClassification Name: Gastrointestinal lesion software detection system Regulation No: 21 CFR 876.1520 \\nClass:   II \\nPredicate device comparison table: \\nTable 1 provides evidence of substantial equivalenc e of the subject device with the predicate device. \\nTable 1: Predicate device comparison table \\nCharacteristic Subject device Predicate device Comparison \\nDevice name GI Genius v.2.0.0 GI Genus v.1.0.2 N/A \\nManufacturer Linkverse Srl, Italy Linkverse Srl, Italy Same \\nFDA clearance K211951 DEN200055 N/A \\nFDA Reg name Gastrointestinal lesion software \\ndetection system Gastrointestinal lesion software detection system Same \\nFDA Reg # 21 CFR 876.1520 21 CFR 876.1520 Same \\nFDA Product Code QNP QNP Same K211951\\nPage 3 of 4', metadata={'source': '/content/K211951.pdf', 'page': 5}), Document(page_content='P4 f 4\\nTable 1: Predicate device comparison table \\nCharacteristic Subject device Predicate device Comparison\\nIndications for Use The GI Genius System is a \\ncomputer-assisted reading tool \\ndesigned to aid endoscopists in detecting colonic mucosal \\nlesions (such as polyps and \\nadenomas) in real time during standard white-light endoscopy examinations of patients \\nundergoing screening and \\nsurveillance endoscopic mucosal evaluations.
